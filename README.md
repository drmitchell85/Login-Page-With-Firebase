# Login-Page-With-Firebase
Login page connected to Firebase with signup, login, and reset password activities.

# Getting Started
In order to implement this setup, you will need to create a Firebase account and connect your app to Firebase. Instructions can be found on the Firebase website as you create an account.

# Overview
This basic introdutory app has four activities:
1) MainActivity: splash page with App logo / title, as well as two options for Signing up or Loggin in
2) Signup Activity: allows users to create an account with an email address and password. If a field is empty users are prompted to finish filling out the necessary information. Information is used to create an account with Firebase.
3) Login Activity: Users log in with email address and password. Firebase authenticates information. Activity also has a link to send users to the reset password activity.
4) Reset password Activity: allows users to reset password by asking Firebase to send a new password to the user's email address.

There is also a profile activity as a placeholder for future information. Currently, users can log out of their account from this activity.

This was created in part from Simplified Code's Firebase Android Tutorial. I strongly suggest checking out their YouTube page as it is highly infomrative and well put together.
